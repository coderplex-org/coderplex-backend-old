## Code of Conduct

Coderplex has adopted [Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/coderplex/coderplex/blob/develop/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect project participants to adhere to.

## Open Development

All work related to the application takes place on Github itself. We use [Issues](https://github.com/coderplex/coderplex-backend/issues) to track bugs, discuss ideas and to engage open source contributors. [Projects](https://github.com/coderplex/coderplex-backend/projects) are used to keep track of everything and is our project management tool. We maintain [Wiki](https://github.com/coderplex/coderplex/wiki) for structuring our long term thoughts. Both core team members and contributors sends a pull request which goes through the same review process. Whole process is as transparent as it can be and we strive to keep it that way.

## Branching Model

The `master` branch of coderplex-backend is relatively stable branch which we update for every release. It is highly recommended for both maintainers and contributors to raise a pull request to `develop` branch. Before every release we throughly test develop branch and merge into master.

_A pull request to any other branch may most likely be closed by our bots_.

## Development Workflow

We welcome pull requests from beginners and django developers alike!

### Work on Issues

1. Find an issue that needs assistance by searching for the [open issues](https://github.com/coderplex/coderplex-backend/labels/help-wanted).
1. If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t accidentally duplicate your effort.
1. If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than a weeks, it’s fine to take over it but you should still leave a comment.

### Proposing a Change

1. Open a new issue if you would like report a bug or suggest improvements.
1. Please wait for core team members to comment on the thread. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

### Prerequisites

1. [Python](https://www.python.org)

   * Minimum version 3.5+

   ```bash
   # To check python version
   python3 -V
   ```

1. [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

   * Installing instructions are at [official docs](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) (Familiarity with git is mandatory).

### Sending a Pull Request

*Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)*

#### Running Locally

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/coderplex/coderplex-backend).
1. Then clone your forked repository
   ```bash
    git clone <your forked repository url>
   ```
1. Move to the repository's root folder
   ```bash
    cd coderplex-backend
   ```
1. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
   ```
1. Activate venv
   ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
   ```
1. Install the requirements
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
   ```
1. Install pre-commit into your git hooks. pre-commit will now run on every commit. Every time you clone a project that is using pre-commit running `pre-commit install` should always be the first thing you do after installing requirements
   ```bash
    pre-commit install
   ```
1. Add an environment variable `EMAIL_HOST_USER`
   ```bash
    echo "export EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your email>" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
1. Add an environment variable `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`
   ```bash
    echo "export EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<your email password>" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
1. Open new terminal session
   ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
   ```
1. Run the migrations
   ```bash
   python webapp/manage.py makemigrations
   python webapp/manage.py migrate
   ```
1. Create a SuperUser
   ```bash
   python webapp/manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
1. Run the Fixtures for adding Social Applications
   ```bash
   python webapp/manage.py loaddata webapp/authentication/fixtures/social_applications.json
   ```
1. Start the development server

   ```bash
    python webapp/manage.py runserver
   ```

   You can now open the App at `localhost:8000` in your browser
   

####Database Setup
1. Install PostgreSQL 
   ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
   ```   
2. Creating User and Database
   ```bash
    sudo -u postgres createuser <username>
    sudo -u postgres createdb <dbname>
   ```   
   Again there are multiple ways of creating a database. You can type 'psql' to enter the command line utility and do
    ```bash
    CREATE USER <user-name> with PASSWORD '<password>';
    CREATE DATABASE <db-name>;
   ```   
3. Connecting to the database
    ```bash
    psql -h localhost -U <username> <db-name> 
   ```   
4. To view the tables used in the app
    ```bash
    SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public';
   ```   
5. To exit
    ```bash
    \q
    exit
   ```  

##### Notes

1. You can see all the implemented APIs in the route `/api-docs`. Any new api that you will create will be automatically appear in `/api-docs` route.
1. To get `code` that will be used to in the `GitHub Login API`, run this [url](https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?scope=user:email&client_id=97d600c693730ed91ac0) in the browser and authorize, then the `code` will be appended as a url param to the redirected_url
1. To get `code` that will be used to in the `LinkedIn Login API`, run this [url](https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?client_id=81ptws4wm9kflx&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback) in the browser and authorize, then the `code` will be appended as a url param to the redirected_url

#### For Production (Contributors can ignore this)

1. Change `client_id` and `client_secret` of social applications
1. Add environment variables `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` and `LINKEDIN_CALLBACK_URL` and set those with `<base_url> + "/callback"`
1. Docker build
   ```bash
    docker build -t production --build-arg build_env="production" -f Dockerfile .
   ```
1. Docker run
   ```bash
    docker run --name coderplex-production  -d -p 8000:8000 production
   ```

#### Before submitting

1. From your fork, create a [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) and name it. eg. `typo-in-readme`
1. If you have added any new packages, you should add those in requirements

   For example, if you have installed `XYZ` package using `pip` in the following way
   ```bash
    pip install XYZ   
   ```
   Then you can add `XYZ` to requirements in the following way.
   ```bash
    pip freeze | grep XYZ >> requirements/requirements.txt
   ```
1. Remove the local `sqlite` database
   ```bash
   rm webapp/coderplex_apis/db.sqlite3
   ```
1. Run the migrations
   ```bash
   python webapp/manage.py makemigrations
   python webapp/manage.py migrate
   ```
1. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
1. Ensure that all tests pass
   ```bash
    python webapp/manage.py test
   ```
1. If any documentation is needed, add docs
1. Add and commit your code. Please give meaningful commit messages.

#### Submitting PullRequest

1. Pull latest code from [upstream repository's](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/)`develop`, if in case anything new were merged while you were working on your fork.
1. Push the code to your fork.
1. Raise the pull request from your created branch to `develop` branch of coderplex. [why develop instead of master branch?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
1. Take some time to give a brief description of the work you have done.

#### After submitting

1. The core team will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

##### Received a review request

* Work on the requested changes
* Push the changes as you did earlier, the pull request will automatically catch those and update itself.
